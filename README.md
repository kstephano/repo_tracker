# LAP 3 Pair Code Challenge: Kelvin Stephano and Bethan Vaughan

## Description

In this assignment we were asked to create a repository tracker app using React, modelled after the GitHub repositories page. The app implements GitHub API to provide the user with an overview of their work stored on GitHub.
The user submits their username and is shown a list of their repos as well as the issue count, stargazers count and fork count of each individual repo. If they enter an invalid username, they are shown an error message, and if they click on the GitHub icon in the top left, they are returned to the welcome page.

## Installation and Usage

### Usage:

- Clone or download the repo
- Navigate to the created folder
- Open terminal and run `npm i`
- To load the app in the browser run `npm run dev`

### Challenges and Achievements

- No big challanges
- Some issues implementing onClick because it was done on the wrong image element.
- Implementing Bootstrap with React was a little challenging, however, after reading the documentation we were able to use it
- We worked together efficiently to meet the requirements of the task
